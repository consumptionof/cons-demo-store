# Overview

This is a simple grocery store program
running on Python 3 and using SQLite.

The store will feature products sold both by weight
and per each item, discounts automatically applied
to products, coupon codes, and rewards card
membership.

## What's working

Currently, the only functioning parts of the program
are the initialization script, which creates an empty
database template with all the requisite information,
and the function to add items to the products table.

The products table, part of the store database,
currently tracks the following:
- An item ID generated by the program.
- The name of the product.
- The code the cashier types in for the product.
  This can take the form of produce PLU numbers
  or the barcode of the item.
- The amount of an item available.
  This is tracked either per item or by weight.
- An available product threshold at which the manager
  is alerted of low stock.
- Whether or not an item will be restocked.
  If not, the manager will not be warned of low stock.
- Whether or not the cashier should manually type in
  the quantity of the product requested.
  This is useful so that the cashier can easily enter,
  for example, eight lemons without having to manually
  specify regular, one-off products as just one every time.
- The price of the product. The program will automatically
  determine whether this price is per each item or by weight.
- Whether or not the item is subject to sales tax.
- Whether or not the item is purchasable with food stamps.
- Whether or not purchasing the item will count towards
  earned rewards points.
- The minimum age the customer must be to purchase the item.
  If set to 0, the register will not ask for a birth date.
- The discounted price offered to rewards card members.


## What's planned:

- A manager GUI program that allows the manager to
  add and modify coupons, products, and rewards card members.
  In the inventory window, it will be able to add new products,
  update their inventory quantity, set discounts, 
  and mark items as no longer stocked.
  In the coupons window, it will be able to add coupons with
  values, item codes, and expiration dates.
  In the rewards member window, it will be able to register
  new customers with their name and phone number,
  and it will automatically generate a unique ID
  of the customer the register can look up.
  (The register will also be able to look up customers by phone number.)
- A cashier GUI program that simulates the sale of products by reading
  product, coupon, and rewards card membership data.
  It will (hopefully) do this without unnecessarily destroying
  any of the tables or data.
  The cashier program will also generate receipts as text files
  containing the total price of the order,
  how much the customer saved with automatic discounts and coupons,
  the rewards points earned during the transaction,
  the rewards points expended during the transaction,
  and the customer's total remaining rewards points.
