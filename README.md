# Overview

This is a simple grocery store program
running on Python 3 and using SQLite.

The store will feature products sold both by weight
and per each item, discounts automatically applied
to products, coupon codes, and rewards card
membership.

## What's working

Currently, the following are the functioning parts of the program:
- The initialization script, which creates an empty
database template with all the requisite information.
- Adding items to the stock table.
- Adding coupons to the coupons table.
- Searching for products, coupons, and rewards card members.


The products table, part of the store database,
currently tracks the following:
- An item ID generated by the program.
- The name of the product.
- The code the cashier types in for the product.
  This can take the form of produce PLU numbers
  or the barcode of the item.
- The amount of an item available.
  This is tracked either per item or by weight.
- An available product threshold at which the manager
  is alerted of low stock.
- Whether or not an item will be restocked.
  If not, the manager will not be warned of low stock.
- Whether or not the cashier should manually type in
  the quantity of the product requested.
  This is useful so that the cashier can easily enter,
  for example, eight lemons without having to manually
  specify regular, one-off products as just one every time.
- The price of the product. The program will automatically
  determine whether this price is per each item or by weight.
- Whether or not the item is subject to sales tax.
- Whether or not the item is purchasable with food stamps.
- Whether or not purchasing the item will count towards
  earned rewards points.
- The minimum age the customer must be to purchase the item.
  If set to 0, the register will not ask for a birth date.
- The discounted price offered to rewards card members.

The coupons table in the same database
currently tracks the following:
- An ID tracked by the program.
- The name of the coupon. Usually similar to
  the item it's discounting.
- A code auto-generated by the program that the
  cashier can manually enter.
- The item code affected by the coupon. If this item
  isn't present in the transaction, the coupon is unavailable.
- Whether a coupon is a fixed discount per pound/each (like $0.50),
  a percent off, or a new price.
- The value of the coupon.
- The minimum number of items required to get the coupon.
  For weighed items, this starts at 0.01.
  It's the same for items sold normally, but it should still
  work the same.
- The maximum number of times the coupon can be applied
  per transaction. 0 is the default, and means there is no limit.
- Whether or not the coupon should be doubled.
- Whether or not the coupon is exclusive to rewards card members.
- The expiration date of the coupon.
- The rewards point cost of the coupon.


## What's planned

- A manager GUI program that allows the manager to
  add and modify coupons, products, and rewards card members.
  In the inventory window, it will be able to add new products,
  update their inventory quantity, set discounts, 
  and mark items as no longer stocked.
  In the coupons window, it will be able to add coupons with
  values, item codes, and expiration dates.
  In the rewards member window, it will be able to register
  new customers with their name and phone number,
  and it will automatically generate a unique ID
  of the customer the register can look up.
  (The register will also be able to look up customers by phone number.)
- A cashier GUI program that simulates the sale of products by reading
  product, coupon, and rewards card membership data.
  It will (hopefully) do this without unnecessarily destroying
  any of the tables or data.
  The cashier program will also generate receipts as text files
  containing the total price of the order,
  how much the customer saved with automatic discounts and coupons,
  the rewards points earned during the transaction,
  the rewards points expended during the transaction,
  and the customer's total remaining rewards points.

### Version 0.05
First of all, I'm going to try to implement version numbers into
the program. That should make it easier to keep track of what
changes happened when. It appears that there have been four
commits before this one, so this version is being called 0.05.

This program uses many functions to determine the validity
of inputs. I've added one such function to detect if a value
is numeric in cases where it should be. I don't think it's
necessary to add one for detecting things that aren't numeric,
though. Plenty of products have numbers in their names, and in a
world where people specifically name their kids after 20th-century
dictators, can you really make any assumptions about people's names?
Off the tangent, the next step is to implement this function
in the database entry functions.
